# beerlist_gui
A GUI for the previous beerlist system using Python 3.6

Should be done!

Could probably do with more testing, especially the Payment tools.

Still needs shell wrappers and a cleanup in the main directory.

Dependencies (Everything can now be installed using PIP3): 
 - PyQt5, pyautogui, pyperclip, pyqrcode, pypng, exchangelib
 - All further dependencies should already be in a standard Python build
 - Note that the special dependencies and requirements of the standalone script updateStudentList.py is listed within this specific file.
